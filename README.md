# RE: Program 
RE: Program is an Educational minimalist puzzle game where you don’t control the robot directly instead, you build its brain.
<br>
Arrange visual command snippets like “Move”, “Jump”, and “Turn” to guide your robot through each level.
Watch it execute your instruction step by step and debug when things don’t go as planned.
<br>
This is a game about logic, patience, and precision.
Every command matters. Every sequence counts.
